# Notes on output folder

## What goes here:

* This is a place for the module to write output files such as position or porfolio reports, flex reports and other data.

* The output folder is set so that only this readme file gets replicated to github.  This protects sensitive data from being pushed up to the repository.

## Useage

dlFlexToMultiXL.py has a sample of sending the output to the output folder

## Folder structure

* Keeping this folder structure as it is setup, will then allow you to put parameter files in the parm folder and output will be written to the output folder from any of the sample code and no sensitive data will be inadvertantly synced up to GitHub.
